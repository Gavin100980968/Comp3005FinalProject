Final Project for Comp 3005, Gavin Osborne_100980968

Inside this repository are three SQL files, each is a demonstration of the code used in the app. 

Initialization.SQL contains the queries that would create the database. 

userQueries.SQL contains the queries that would be invoked when the application was running in user mode. This file won't execute as written because the input sections of the queries do not have specified values. 

ownerQueries.SQL contains the queries that would be invoked when the application was running in Owner mode. This file also won't execute as written because the input sections do not have specified values.
